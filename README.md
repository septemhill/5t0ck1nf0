## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v20.x or later)
*   pnpm (v9.x or later)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository (remember to replace `your-username/qdash` with your actual repository path):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/qdash.git
    cd qdash
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables:
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the necessary API keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    The `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY` is required to run the scheduled task (`pnpm run schedule`).

4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the result.

## üìú Available Scripts

*   `pnpm dev`: Starts the application in development mode.
*   `pnpm build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `pnpm start`: Starts the production server.
*   `pnpm lint`: Lints the code using ESLint.
*   `pnpm schedule`: Executes the scheduled data update script.

## üö¢ Deployment

This project is configured with a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow (defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).

*   When new commits are pushed to the `main` branch, it automatically builds and deploys to the `gh-pages` branch.
*   A daily scheduled job runs the `pnpm run schedule` script to update data. If there are changes, it automatically commits and pushes them, which in turn triggers a new deployment.
